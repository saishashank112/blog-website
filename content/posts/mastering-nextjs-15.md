excerpt: "Explore the latest features of Next.js 15, including selective hydration, improved caching strategies, and the new React Compiler integration."

## React Compiler by Default
Next.js 15 fully leverages the React Compiler, eliminating the need for manual memoization like useMemo and useCallback in many cases.

## Selective Hydration
Performance is better than ever with more granular control over which parts of your page hydrate and when.

```javascript
// New caching strategy example
export const dynamic = 'force-static';
```

## Enhanced Developer Experience
Faster builds and better error messages make working with Next.js 15 a joy.
